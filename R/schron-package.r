#' @description
#' `schron` uses available methods from [rbacon::rbacon] and [Bchron::Bchron] to build
#' chronologies for several sedimentary cores, using available information of
#' synchronic *event layers* between cores to further constraint the
#' overall chronology. The package provides a set of formal classes and methods
#' tailored at computing a *shared chronology*, but also suitable for general
#' manipulation of sediment core data or alike.
